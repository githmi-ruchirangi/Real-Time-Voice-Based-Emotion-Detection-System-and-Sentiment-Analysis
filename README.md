Developed a system to detect human emotions from elderly people's voice inputs using a custom CNN+LSTM model trained with PyTorch. The system continuously monitors and reports the emotional state over time, performs text-based sentiment analysis based on the overall conversation with the chatbot, suggests activities based on the userâ€™s mood, and notifies caregivers or responsible parties of potential health concerns.
