This is the CNN+LSTM model which is trained using Ravdess dataset.
Model has been built using Pytorch.
Mel Spectograms
AWDN


This is after applying,
# Save the scaler's mean and scale
np.save('scaler_mean.npy', scaler.mean_)
np.save('scaler_scale.npy', scaler.scale_)

But, it doesnot give a output because of the mismatch between the shape of the mel_spectrogram 
and the expected shape by the StandardScaler.
I'm going to debug it and Ensure that the modelI'm loading is compatible with the scaler and input shape.Then I retrain the model as my 3rd attempt.
